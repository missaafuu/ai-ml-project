# AI in Healthcare: Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to build a predictive system for early disease diagnosis. By analyzing patient data such as symptoms, medical history, and risk factors, the model can predict the likelihood of diseases like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.

## 🔍 Project Goal

To create a smart healthcare tool that:
- Improves early disease detection
- Helps doctors and patients make data-driven decisions
- Reduces the workload on manual diagnosis

## 🧠 What the Model Does
- Collects and preprocesses patient health records
- Uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks
- Predicts whether a patient is at risk
- Displays the result on a simple web interface
